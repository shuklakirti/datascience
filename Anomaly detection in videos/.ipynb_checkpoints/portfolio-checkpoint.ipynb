    "For Anomaly detection in videos, Instead of treating it as supervised learning and Labeling the videos as Normal and abnormal, I have used another approach and did the anomaly detection by unsupervised learning.It is difficult to obtain abnormal videos as compared to normal videos. Even in self automated cars, the biggest challenge is to get accident videos because it is very difficult to get them and also to generate them.\n",
    "Spatiotemporal architecture is proposed for anomaly detection in videos including crowded scenes. It contains two main components, one for spatial feature representation, and one for learning the temporal evolution of the spatial features.\n",
    "I have trained my model by only normal videos(some outliers) and while testing, when abnormal videos are given to this trained model, the reconstruction error for such videos goes above threshold and anomaly is detected.\n",
    "\n",
    "This application can be used in video surveillance to detect abnormal events as it’s based on unsupervised learning, the advantage being that the only ingredient required is a long video segment containing only normal events in a fixed view"

    "Suspicious events that are of interest in long video sequences, such as surveillance footage usually have an extremely low probability of occurring. Manually detecting such events, or anomalies, is a very meticulous job that often requires more manpower than is generally available. Hence, there is a need for Automate detection.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "Treating the task as a binary classification problem (normal and abnormal)  proved it being effective and accurate, but the practicality of such method is limited since footages of abnormal events are difficult to obtain due to its rarity. Hence, it is more efficient to train a model using little to no supervision, including spatiotemporal features and autoencoders . Unlike supervised methods, these methods only require unlabelled video footages which contain little or no abnormal event, which are easy to obtain in real-world applications.\n",
    "\n",
    " In this project, video data set is represented by a set of general features, which are inferred automatically from a long video footage through a deep learning approach. Specifically, a deep neural network composed of a stack of convolutional autoencoders was used to process video frames in an unsupervised manner that captured spatial structures in the data, which, grouped together, compose the video representation. Then, this representation is fed into a stack of convolutional temporal autoencoders to learn the regular temporal patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "The method described here is based on the principle that when an abnormal event occurs, the most recent frames of video will be significantly different than the older frames. Trained an end-to-end model that consists of a spatial feature extractor and a temporal encoder-decoder which together learns the temporal patterns of the input volume of frames. The model is trained with video volumes consists of only normal scenes, with the objective to minimize the reconstruction error between the input video volume and the output video volume reconstructed by the learned model. After the model is properly trained, normal video volume is expected to have low reconstruction error, whereas video volume consisting of abnormal scenes is expected to have high reconstruction error. By thresholding on the error produced by each testing input volumes, our system will be able to detect when an abnormal event occurs."

    "**The model gave decent predictions on all the 3, Testing dataset, on a standalone video and on a live feed. The training data had maximum data of people walking far away from the camera and hence when someone walks near to the camera, the model shows Anomaly Found. The verification of the prediction of model on the Testing dataset was done by manually visiting the testing dataset frames and calculating the video from the frame bunch number and FramesPerSeconds used to extract frames from videos. Since its an unsupervised model, this was the only approach came to my mind to evaluate the model's testing accuracy. Hence apart from the frame numbers and bunch numbers, i could not display any other data to showcase the model accuracy.**"
