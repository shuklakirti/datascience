# Anomaly Detection in videos using Semi-supervised Learning

## Abstract
For Anomaly detection in videos, Instead of treating it as supervised learning and Labeling the videos as Normal and abnormal, I have used another approach and did the anomaly detection by unsupervised learning.
Spatiotemporal architecture is proposed for anomaly detection in videos including crowded scenes. It contains two main components, one for spatial feature representation, and one for learning the temporal evolution of the spatial features.
I have trained my model by only normal videos(some outliers) and while testing, when abnormal videos are given to this trained model, the reconstruction error for such videos goes above threshold and anomaly is detected.

This application can be used in video surveillance to detect abnormal events as it’s based on unsupervised learning, the advantage being that the only ingredient required is a long video segment containing only normal events in a fixed view

## Instructions
* Run each cell of 'portfolio.ipynb' notebook.
* 'experiments.ipynb' notebook has different experiments performed for finalizing the model
